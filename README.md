This project will strive to use *The Pitchfork Layout (PFL)* for it's project directory.
It's not quite there yet, though.

In order to download the dependencies please run

    git submodules update --init --recursive
    
prior to building the project.

From `git@github.com:tcbrindle/span.git` under BSL-1.0:
